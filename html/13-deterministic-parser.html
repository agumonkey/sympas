<H1>A deterministic parser</H1>
<P>
In previous chapters we have always designed top down,
in this chapter we shall design at least in part bottom up.
We are given a machine with just three instructions,
<EM>call</EM>v>, <EM>return</EM> and one other
having to do with <EM>match</EM>ing an input character with one
of a set of allowed characters.
Our task is to design a high level front end for this machine.
The result is a fairly general parser which reads a
grammar to be translated into machine code.
The machine then reads strings and determines whether
they are in the language defined by the grammar.
<H2>A very simple parsing machine</H2>
<P>
One aim of this chapter is to make the notion
of procedure call and return explicit.
We have used procedures in all our programs,
and we have implemented languages in which recursion was possible.
But in almost all our implementations we have always relied on
the recursion facility offered by our implementation language.
The one exception was the predictive parser used in the semantic tableaux
program in Chapter~10.
In this chapter we shall see how recursion really works,
by studying a system in which there is call and return
and almost nothing else.
Of course there has to be something else,
otherwise there would be no point at all to the calls and returns.
The third instruction will be for matching characters
which are being read from a file.
If the currently visible character in the file is
one of a set of allowed characters,
then execution continues at one place, otherwise at another place.
<P>
In detail,
the instructions consist of up to four fields:
an operation, two addresses and a set of characters.
Only the matching instruction uses all four fields.
<XMP>
                field1          field2  field3  field4
 
        1.      call            ad1     ad2     -
        2.      return          -       -       -
        3.      match           ad1     ad2     char-set
</XMP>
The parsing machine interprets code consisting of an array of instructions.
It maintains a program counter which always points to the instruction
currently being executed.
The machine also maintains a stack of return addresses.
The program counter is constantly updated by the instruction being executed,
and in the case of the return instruction
the exact value is popped from the stack where it has previously been
pushed by a call instruction.
The machine reads characters from an input file.
Apart from the one character lookahead,
there is no input buffer and hence no possibility
to backtrack,
to back up to a previous position in the input string.
Therefore only deterministic parsing is possible.
In detail,
the machine operates as follows:
<XMP>
Read the first character
Set the program counter to the first code address
REPEAT
    WITH the code pointed at by the program counter DO
        CASE the operation OF
            call :
                push ad1 onto the stack
                set the program counter to ad2
            return :
                pop the saved address into the program counter
            match :
                IF the current character from the input file
                   is a member of the set char-set
                THEN
                    read the next character from the input file
                    set the program counter to ad1
                ELSE
                    set the program counter to ad2
    UNTIL
        the program counter does not point to a legal address
</XMP>
<P>
The input string from the file is accepted if the program counter
has a special <EM>accept</EM> value at termination
and the end of the input string has been reached.
So, unlike the parser of Chapter~11,
acceptance requires the whole input string to be well-formed.
<P>
Our task is to design a high-level BNF-like language
and to write a compiler from this high level language
to the machine language of three instructions.
The general parser of Chapter~11 was able to handle any context free
grammar.
The one to be developed in this chapter is less general,
it can only handle deterministic grammars
in which there is no need to backtrack.
This restriction results from the inability of the parsing machine
to go back to a previous position in the input file.
The machine has another potential shortcoming:
there is no way for a call to return
and to signal to the callee whether it was successful.
For the grammar this has the consequence that
in a group of alternatives all but possibly the last
has to start with a terminal.
In the version to be developed here,
such terminals even have to be explicitly given at the point of choice.
(See one of the exercises for the design
of a less restrictive version.)
<H2>Sample runs</H2>
<P>
What follows is a record of two runs of the program LL1GEN.
In the first run a grammar for logical expressions is given;
for variety negation is not handled by recursion.
The first version of that grammar contains an intentional
context sensitive error which is promptly reported.
The second version of the same grammar is acceptable.
It is followed by a listing of the internal code
that has been generated.
Note that some match instructions have an empty
characterset, and since no current input character can match,
these instructions are effectively <CODE>GOTO</CODE>s.
Then follow some input strings to be parsed,
first some acceptable input strings and then some
unacceptable input strings.
For the first acceptable string and for the first
unacceptable string the tracing facility is turned on.
The tracing shows the current character from the input file,
the top of the stack indicating the depth of the calls,
the value of the program counters
and then the relevant fields of the current instruction:
the operation field
and the remaining three fields as required.
<P>
In the second run a grammar for a simple imperative
language is given.
Note that statements are optional,
this allows semicolons to be followed by an empty statement ---
and hence semicolons can be used as statement terminators
instead of separators.
Since the internal code for this grammar is quite large,
it is not shown.
Then follow three programs,
two with an error and one without.
Even though the programs are quite short,
the trace of their parses would be quite long,
so it is not shown.

<H2>Designing the implementation</H2>
<P>
The implementation owes a great deal to Wirth's (1976)
general parser (pp 304 - 307) and to a later variant (Wirth 1977).
The parser presented here differs from Wirth's
in the following respects:
As seen by the user,
Wirth's has single letters as non-terminals for the grammars,
whereas the one here has multi-letter terminals.
Both are for languages in which the symbols are single characters,
but Wirth's uses single letter terminals in the grammar,
whereas the one here allows sets of single letter terminals in the grammar.
Internally, not seen by the user,
Wirth's parsing machine is recursive,
the one here is not.
This one can also write the internal representation
of the grammar because it uses an array rather than pointers,
and it can trace execution.
<H3>The parsing procedures</H3>
<P>
The program consists of a number of procedures for reading the grammar
and generating the internal code,
and one procedure which implements the parsing machine
described at the beginning.
The main program is very simple:
it calls a procedure to read a grammar,
and then it repeatedly prompts for input strings to be parsed
by the machine.
<P>
<EM>The scanner</EM>:
The individual symbols to be recognised by the scanner
are almost the same as the ones that were required for the
general parser for context-free languages in Chapter~11.
They are identifiers for the non-terminals of the grammar,
together with a few single character symbols.
Note again that the non-terminal identifiers are looked up
and, if they are new, entered into the symbol table.
In addition this scanner has to recognise sets of terminal characters
listed within double quotes.
So, when the opening double quote is seen,
any following characters are collected into a global variable
of type <CODE>SET OF char</CODE>, up to the closing double quote.
That global variable needs to be available
to procedure <CODE>factor</CODE> for the case when the current symbol
is a set of terminals.
<P>
<EM>Reading the Grammar</EM>:
The syntax of the input grammar is so similar to that in Chapter~11
that only a brief description of the parsing procedures
is necessary.
The productions for the non-terminals
factor, term and expression
are recursive,
so they have to be handled by procedures of the same name.
It would be possible to handle productions and the grammar
entirely in the main program,
as it was done in Chapter~11.
However, several special purpose variables are required
which are best left hidden inside procedures
which handle productions and the grammar.
Visibility requirements are satisfied by the following
nesting pattern:
<XMP>
        PROCEDURE grammar
            PROCEDURE production
                PROCEDURE expression
                    PROCEDURE term
                        PROCEDURE factor
</XMP>
The gross structure of these five procedures
is familiar by now;
it is best to write them first without code generation in mind.
<P>
Procedure <CODE>grammar</CODE> has to initialise the symbol table and then read
one or more productions.
Following that it has to check that all non-terminals are indeed
defined.
Procedure <CODE>production</CODE> expects a leading identifier,
it is a good idea to let it check that the identifier has not
been declared before --- even if it might have been used before.
One way to do the check
is to see that in the symbol table no code for it has been recorded.
Following the identifier, an equal sign
<CODE>=</CODE> is expected and then an expression.
Procedures <CODE>expression</CODE>, <CODE>term</CODE> and <CODE>factor</CODE>
present no difficulties.
<H3>Code generation</H3>
<P>
In all our previous programs code generation was a relatively simple matter
because the conceptual distance between the external source language
and the internal target language was so small.
This is no longer true here,
because so many constructions of the source language
have no counterpart in the target language.
In particular,
the two binary operations of alternation and concatenation,
and the two unary operations of repetition and option
have no counterparts.
Instead they will have to be implemented
by explicit <CODE>GOTO</CODE>s in the instruction for matching sets of terminals.
<P>
The situation is similar for translating high level imperative
languages containing <CODE>IF</CODE> and <CODE>WHILE</CODE> statements
into low level machine languages that only have <CODE>GOTO</CODE>s.
The <CODE>IF</CODE> statement requires a <CODE>GOTO</CODE> which will cause execution to skip over
some code in case the condition is false,
and the <CODE>WHILE</CODE> statement requires an additional backwards <CODE>GOTO</CODE>
to create a loop.
This is not particularly difficult,
since there is a fairly simple correspondence
between the  <CODE>GOTO</CODE>s and the required target addresses.
We shall encounter an example in Chapter~14.
<P>
In the present case, however,
the calculation of the target addresses is not so simple.
It is best to conceive of code generation to consist
of two steps:
1) generating the op-codes and
2) calculating the addresses.
<P>
<EM>Generating op-codes</EM>:
If addresses are ignored for the time being,
generating op-codes is the easiest part.
At the end of every production a return instruction
has to be generated,
and since this does not need an address,
it need not be changed or fixed up later.
The other three instructions
are generated inside procedure factor.
The case for an identifier,
representing a non-terminal,
requires a call instruction to be generated,
together with the position of the identifier in the symbol table.
The case of a set of terminal symbols
requires a match instruction to be generated,
with the two address fields left unspecified.
For the repetition and option cases, enclosed in brackets or braces,
an odd match instruction is generated ---
one in which the set of characters is empty,
and which hence will never match.
Hence such instructions are in effect unconditional jump instructions.
The purpose of this strange instruction is to become
the target address of some of the implicit  <CODE>GOTO</CODE>s
that will be generated by the expression enclosed in the brackets or braces.
<P>
<EM>Calculating addresses</EM>:
The method employed here borrows heavily from Wirth (1976, pp 302 - 307)
and a later version in Wirth (1977).
When the entire grammar has been read and the internal code
has been generated,
a single pass through the entire code is made.
Its purpose is to change the second address
of the strange match instructions to the first address
which by now contains the next success address to be continued with.
(Note that Wirth's general parser manages without this oddity.)
<P>
Remember, when a call instruction is initially generated,
the non-terminal being called may not yet have been defined;
so at most the address in the symbol table can be recorded
in the instruction.
In the general parsing program of Chapter~11
the fix-up pass replaces the address in the symbol table recorded
in the instruction by the start address of the code for
the non-terminal which is now known.
We could do the same here,
to make the interpreter slightly more efficient.
But to do so would interfere with one of the exercises.
<H3>The interpreter</H3>
<P>
The interpreter is not recursive,
so it could easily be made part of the main program.
However, it contains a few variables only used here,
so for modularity it is better to have it as a separate procedure.
<P>
The necessary variables are an array of integers serving as the stack
of return addresses,
and two integers for the top of stack and for the program counter.
It is also useful to have a procedure which reads characters
and skips non-printing characters.
For tracing, if the first character of the input string is a <CODE>?</CODE>
then the header line has to be written out.
<P>
The machine is then initialised by setting the program counter to 1
and by pushing a dummy return address -1 onto an otherwise empty stack.
The purpose of this dummy is to signal successful
termination,
provided the end of the input string has been reached.
Otherwise failure is reported, together with the last character seen.
<P>
The principal <CODE>REPEAT</CODE> loop of the machine
(in the middle of procedure <CODE>parse</CODE>) has already been described
at the beginning.
When tracing is on,
every step through the <CODE>REPEAT</CODE> loop
has to write out the current input character,
the top of the stack,
the program counter
and the relevant fields of the current instruction.

<H2>Exercises and reading</H2>
<P>
<EM>Another grammar</EM>:
The grammar in the second example used <CODE>LOGICAL</CODE>
instead of <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE>
because the <CODE>B</CODE> of <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE> would
interfere with the <CODE>B</CODE> of <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>.
Also, it used <CODE>PRINT</CODE> instead of <CODE>WRITE</CODE> because the <CODE>W</CODE> of <CODE>WRITE</CODE>
would interfere with the <CODE>W</CODE> of <CODE>WHILE</CODE>.
Can you rewrite the grammar using <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE> and <CODE>WRITE</CODE>?
<P>
<EM>Manual</EM>:
Write a user manual.
You need not mention anything strictly internal
to the program,
and you need not mention the tracing facility either.
<P>
<EM>More generality</EM>:
The scanner cannot handle the double quote character
as a terminal because it uses it as a delimiter.
Can you find a way of allowing double quotes
as terminals, preferably as a member of a set of terminals?
Similarly for <CODE>.</CODE> which terminates the input string,
and the <CODE>?</CODE> which switches on tracing if it precedes the input string.
<P>
<EM>Post Mortem</EM>:
Some programming language implementations give a dump
of the run-time stack when an error has occurred.
The dump lists the procedure and function calls
that were accumulated on the stack.
A similar facility would be useful for our parsing machine.
To implement this,
the call instruction should push onto the stack
not the address of the next instruction to be executed,
but its own address.
This is the reason why the call instruction has been given as
its second address field
not the code address as fixed up after the entire grammar has been read
but the original symbol table address.
Then, for the post mortem
the stack will contain a sequence
of addresses into the code left there by
executing call instructions.
>From each address one can determine the code record
to which it points,
and the second address field of that record is an address
into the symbol table where the name of the non-terminal is
to be found.
Clearly the return instruction will have to be changed
so that it sets the program counter not to the
code address popped from the stack
but to the first address field in the code
at the address popped.
See also Setzer (1979) for some ideas.
<P>
<EM>Eliminating redundant instructions</EM>:
The match instructions with an empty character set
were really just unconditional jumps.
It is possible to make a further pass through the code,
and if any address in a proper match instruction
points to such a dummy match instruction,
it could be made to point to what that dummy points to.
The replacement should be done with a loop to catch those
cases in which a dummy points to a dummy and so on.
Note that a fix up of this kind will
save execution time, but it will not
shorten the code because it does not eliminate the
instructions.
An optimisation which also shortens the code
is much more difficult
(optimising compilers do it routinely).
<P>
<EM>Cleaner code generation</EM>:
There is something quite unsatisfactory about
the way the code is generated and then fixed up.
It may well be that it is better
to generate tree code first
and then produce an optimised linear code from that.
<P>
<EM>Reducing the number of instructions</EM>:
(A machine with just three kinds of instructions is rather minimal,
but there are machines with less.
The extreme is a machine with only one instruction
which always consists of two addresses,
but some special addresses are used for gaining diversity.)
Delete the return instruction:
if next <CODE>pc = 0</CODE> then get it from the stack,
but if that is empty then exit.
<P>
<EM>Multi-character words</EM>:
Modify the translator and the interpreter
so that the program can handle symbols consisting
of several characters.
Then the second grammar could use
<CODE>"BEGIN"</CODE> instead of
<CODE>"B"</CODE> <CODE>"E"</CODE> <CODE>"G"</CODE> <CODE>"I"</CODE> <CODE>"N"</CODE>,
<CODE>"IF"</CODE> instead of <CODE>"I"</CODE> <CODE>"F"</CODE>,
and so forth.
But this redesign should not interfere with the facility
for sets of single characters, such as <CODE>"abc"</CODE>.
So you will need another matching operation.
Note also that it will then be possible
to have <CODE>WRITE</CODE> rather than <CODE>PRINT</CODE>,
because the <CODE>W</CODE> will not interfere with <CODE>WHILE</CODE>.
But you will need a buffer in the parsing machine.
<P>
<EM>Status return</EM>:
The parsing machine has no way for a call to return
and to signal to the callee whether the call was successful.
Consequently in the second example given,
the set of lower case letters (as names of potential variables)
had to be specified literally in four different places in the grammar.
It would have been neater to be able to use a defined
non-terminal here,
but since variables are only one way of beginning statements
or factors,
the calls to that non-terminal have to return a status signal
to the callee.
Implement such an addition to the parsing machine.
<P>
<EM>Reading</EM>:
Wirth's general parser is described in (1976, pp 295 - 307),
and a later version is in his (1977, in German).
It is implemented recursively and uses a VAR parameter
for a status return.
Setzer (1979) discusses a quite different method
of using the original internal code from Wirth's parser
to drive a non-recursive parsing machine.
<P>
<EM>A Translating Machine</EM>:
This is an exercise in the design of a specialised
pseudo machine language and a software interpreter
that can be used for simple translations from and to single
character languages.
To keep it as simple as possible, restrict yourself to translation
from prefix to fully parenthesised infix,
or from fully parenthesised infix to postfix.
<P>
One way to do this is to follow the prefix to infix translator
of Chapter~2 by implementing instructions for each of the basic
steps which that translator needed.
About 10 or 12 instructions are needed:
1) write instructions for literal characters,
for a local variable and for messages,
2) read instructions for a local variable
and for skipping the remainder of the input line on error,
3) flow of control instructions such as an unconditional <CODE>GOTO</CODE>,
a call and a return instruction which also have
to take care of a local variable,
and a conditional <CODE>GOTO</CODE> which tests whether
the local variable is in a given set,
4) an instruction to clear the stack initially and on errors, and
5) an instruction to do character translations.
The same instruction set should be adequate for translating
from fully parenthesised infix to postfix.
However, for translation from minimally parenthesised infix
a few different instructions will be needed.
<P>
There are at least three ways in which the required program can be
placed into the code array before it is executed.
One way is to write the assembly program by hand
and to use an (undoubtedly ugly) initialisation section
to fill the required fields of the code.
Another way is to write an assembler which takes a readable
assembly language program from a file
and places it into an array for execution.
A third way is to elaborate the grammar translator written
in this chapter by getting procedure factor
to recognise special action symbols which are needed for the
translations.
Of course all of the above can also be done just for parsing
without any translation.
