<H1>Operator precedence parsing</H1>
<P>
In previous chapters we have seen several parsers, evaluators and translators.
All used <EM>recursive descent</EM>, one of the top down methods.
This chapter introduces one very simple form of
<EM>bottom up</EM> parsing and translating.
<H2>Bottom up parsing</H2>
<P>
Consider the following fragment of a Pascal program:
<XMP>
        IF  x = 0  THEN  y := 1
</XMP>
You can see immediately that this is a statement,
and not a program or an expression or a factor or anything else.
A recursive descent compiler for Pascal will recognise it as a statement,
but only if the compiler is currently expecting a statement.
If it is currently expecting a program
or a type or an expression or something else,
then it will respond with error messages.
Note that you were able to recognise the fragment because you had
no expectations.
This is an essential difference between a top down parsing method like
recursive descent,
and the bottom up method you were using in your head.
In this chapter we shall study bottom up methods applied
to parsing and translating.
In all of these the parser does not start off with definite expectations
but reads symbols as they come along and makes sense of them.
<P>
The basic idea is that just as expressions can be evaluated by
several passes which evaluate subexpressions,
so sequences of symbols can be parsed by several passes which
parse subexpressions.
First, consider the following equivalent formulas
in prefix, in fully parenthesised infix, and in postfix notation:
All three are to be evaluated,
by rewriting leftmost subformulas by their values when possible;
note that <EM>time flows from top to bottom</EM>:
<XMP>
prefix:                 infix:                      postfix:
> - = 0 - & 1 1 0       (-(0 = -(1 & 1)) > 0)       0 1 1 & - = - 0 >
> - = 0 - 1     0       (-(0 = -   1   ) > 0)       0     1 - = - 0 >
> - = 0 0       0       (-(0 = 0       ) > 0)       0       0 = - 0 >
> - 1           0       (-   1           > 0)                 1 - 0 >
> 0             0       (0               > 0)                   0 0 >
1                                        1                          1
</XMP>
If we ignore the difference in meaning between the
various operands and operators and merely consider syntax,
then we could rewrite all well-formed subformulas
by <CODE>F</CODE> to indicate that they are formulas, like this:
<XMP>
prefix:                 infix:                      postfix:
> - = 0 - & 1 1 0       (-(0 = -(1 & 1)) > 0)       0 1 1 & - = - 0 >
> - = F - & 1 1 0       (-(F = -(1 & 1)) > 0)       F 1 1 & - = - 0 >
> - = F - & F 1 0       (-(F = -(F & 1)) > 0)       F F 1 & - = - 0 >
> - = F - & F F 0       (-(F = -(F & F)) > 0)       F F F & - = - 0 >
> - = F - F     0       (-(F = -   F   ) > 0)       F     F - = - 0 >
> - = F F       0       (-(F = F       ) > 0)       F       F = - 0 >
> - F           0       (-   F           > 0)                 F - 0 >
> F             0       (F               > 0)                   F 0 >
> F             F       (F               > F)                   F F >
F                                        F                          F
</XMP>
<P>
As described, the method would require us to always start at the beginning
of the symbol sequence and perform the first replacement,
just as we did for evaluation by replacement.
But from our truth table program you will remember that a very good method
for evaluating uses an auxiliary stack which contains whatever needs
to be remembered about the values computed so far.
We could even imagine a method which is less efficient than the one
we used there, but which is interesting;
as we pass through the postfix formula,
we push all symbols onto the stack, operands and operators.
If <EM>at any time</EM> the top few elements of the stack consist of a few
operands topped by an operator,
we interrupt the pushing and replace the operator and its operands
by the result value.
For comparison, here are the two evaluation methods;
note that <EM>time flows from left to right</EM>:
<XMP>
efficient method:               less efficient method:
0 1 1 & - = - 0 >               0 1 1 &   -   =   -   0 >
                                      &
    1                               1 1   -   =         >
  1 1 1 0     0                   1 1 1 1 1 0 0   -   0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1               0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
</XMP>
For either method, if instead of 0 and 1 on the stack we always
had <CODE>F</CODE> (for <CODE>formula</CODE>),
we would have a parsing method which avoids having to
restart at the beginning of the formula every time.
This is how it will look:
<XMP>
efficient method:               less efficient method:
0 1 1 & - = - 0 >               0 1 1 &   -   =   -   0 >
                                      &
    F                               F F   -   =         >
  F F F F     F                   F F F F F F F   -   F F
F F F F F F F F F               F F F F F F F F F F F F F F
</XMP>
<P>
The less efficient method lends itself to becoming a very general parsing method
which can be used for the other notations, too.
Here it is used for fully parenthesised infix notation:
<XMP>
        ( - ( 0 = - ( 1 & 1 )     )     > 0 )
                            )
                          F F
                        & & &
                      F F F F
                    ( ( ( ( ( F   )
                  - - - - - - - F F
                = = = = = = = = = =         )
              F F F F F F F F F F F       F F
            ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( F   > > >
          - - - - - - - - - - - - - - F F F F
        ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( F
                              1 2   3 4       5
</XMP>
Note that most steps push the current input symbol onto the stack,
but there are five <EM>reduction</EM>
 steps, marked <CODE>1..5</CODE>.
Here is a brief formulation of the algorithm:
<XMP>
        start with an empty stack
        REPEAT
            IF the top few symbols on the stack can be replaced by
                    a single one in accordance with the grammar
                THEN do the replacement
                ELSE push the next symbol onto the stack
            UNTIL the end of the string has been reached
</XMP>
At the end of this, the stack should contain a single non-terminal
of the grammar, and this is what has been recognised.
As described,
the algorithm is not very efficient,
because for example in the case of fully parenthesised infix formulas
up to five symbols on the stack have to be examined in the <CODE>IF</CODE> part.
To improve the algorithm,
we can make partial reductions
and also make the applicability of reductions depend on the next
input symbol.
This idea is used in most bottom up parsers,
including the two very specialised ones to follow.
<H2>Precedence relations</H2>
<P>
In the remainder of this chapter we shall look at two related bottom up
parsing methods which are very simple and efficient,
but are applicable only to a rather narrow class of languages.
<H3>The algorithm</H3>
<P>
Consider arithmetic or logical expressions in minimally parenthesised
notation
as written in the first line and their fully parenthesised form
in the second line.
<XMP>
        x +  y * z                      p v  q & r
        x + (y * z)                     p v (q & r)
</XMP>
The usual convention is that <CODE>*</CODE> binds more strongly than <CODE>+</CODE>,
and that <CODE>&</CODE> binds more strongly than <CODE>v</CODE>.
Hence <CODE>y</CODE> is an operand to <CODE>*</CODE> and not to <CODE>+</CODE>,
and <CODE>q</CODE> is an operand to <CODE>&</CODE> and not to <CODE>v</CODE>.
It helps to think of the operators on the left and right of <CODE>y</CODE> and <CODE>q</CODE>
tugging at it,
and <CODE>*</CODE> and <CODE>&</CODE> win.
The technical notion is that <CODE>*</CODE> has precedence over <CODE>+</CODE>,
and that <CODE>&</CODE> has precedence over <CODE>v</CODE>.
For binary operators that are semantically associative
it does not matter whether they have precedence over themselves,
but for others it is important to distinguish those that are
syntactically left-associative (such as subtraction and implication),
and those that are syntactically right-associative
(such as exponentiation in arithmetic).
<P>
We shall now design a parser for logical formulas in
minimally parenthesised infix notation.
In the following table,
the row headings are for the operator on the left of the disputed operand,
and the column headings are for the operator on the right of the operand.
The table entries <CODE>></CODE> indicate that the row operator, when on the left,
has precedence over the column operator, when on the right.
The table entries <CODE><</CODE> indicate the reverse.
<XMP>
                "&"   "v"   ">"
              +----------------
          "&" |  >     >     >
          "v" |  <     >     >
          ">" |  <     <     <
</XMP>
This table is part of a larger table which has rows and columns for symbols
that are not binary operators:
atomic formulas, negation, the two parentheses,
and a terminator, say the period <CODE>.</CODE>
The notion of a symbol having precedence over another now has to
be extended to cover these other symbols.
It so turns out that apart from <CODE><</CODE> and <CODE>></CODE>
a third entry, <CODE>=</CODE>, is needed.
Finally, for illegal combinations,
the entries can be error codes.
<P>
A minor problem arises about <CODE>v</CODE> being used as an infix connective
and as an atomic formula.
In the case of recursive descent parsing there was no problem,
even a formula such as <CODE>v v v v v</CODE> is correctly recognised
as the three-fold disjunction of <CODE>v</CODE> with itself.
However, for operator precedence parsing this will not work,
and henceforth we shall use <CODE>#</CODE> as the disjunction symbol.
<P>
That larger table can then be used to drive an algorithm which
is a descendant of the one outlined at the end of the last section.
Instead of pushing symbols from the input onto the stack
and then comparing them with what is below,
the comparison is done between the current input symbol
and the top element.
Instead of reducing only when the full right hand side
of a production of the grammar has been seen,
partial reductions take place.
Instead of reducing non-terminals (such as <CODE>F</CODE> in the example),
the only symbols on the stack are terminals.
The net effect of the three changes is a very simple and very efficient
bottom up parsing method:
<XMP>
        Push a marker onto an otherwise empty stack
        WHILE stack contains more than one symbol OR
            the current input symbol is not the terminator DO
          LET R be the precedence relation between
            the symbol on top of the stack and the next input symbol
          IF R is < OR R is = THEN
            shift the next input symbol onto the stack
          ELSE IF R is > THEN
            REPEAT
              pop the top element off the stack
              UNTIL the precedence relation between
                the symbol on top of the stack and
                the most recently popped symbol is <
          ELSE abort with error R
</XMP>
With the information given so far,
it should not be too difficult to write the program.
The precedence relations can be built into the algorithm
at the <CODE>LET</CODE> part of the loop.
Alternatively, the algorithm can be left quite general
and the <CODE>LET</CODE> part implemented as a lookup of a two dimensional array.
In this way it is this array or table which specifies the language;
such table driven parsing is a popular implementation technique
for bottom up parsers.
No matter which implementation is chosen,
the hard part is to specify the precedence relations between
symbols other than the infix operators.
A very minor addition to the program turns it into an infix
to postfix translator.
<P>
The following is the record of an interaction with the program.
The program does not echo its input,
which is ideal for interactive use.
After each prompt <CODE>ready</CODE>,
it reads a formula typed by the user.
If the formula is preceded by <CODE>?</CODE>,
then the program goes into tracing mode.
Note that the first three formulas are being parsed and translated
in tracing mode,
where the stack is now written horizontally.
For the remaining formulas tracing is switched off.
The last formulas contain intentional errors.

<H3>The program</H3>
<P>
The following is the Pascal source program
for the operator precedence parser/translator
based on precedence relations.
Note that the <CODE>VALUE</CODE> declaration is not standard Pascal,
it initialises the (two dimensional) <CODE>ARRAY</CODE> of precedence relations.
Note that it this <CODE>ARRAY</CODE> which specifies the syntax of the input language,
the remainder of the program is quite general.
(The <CODE>VALUE</CODE> declaration could be replaced by some other
initialisation mechanism;
one possibility is 64 assignment statements,
another is 8 calls of a procedure with 8 parameters,
another is reading the matrix from a file.)

<H2>Precedence functions</H2>
<P>
This section describes a variant of the algorithm
which replaces the two dimensional (and hence potentially large)
array of precedence relations by two one-dimensional arrays.
<H3>The algorithm</H3>
<P>
The precedence relations between binary operators need not be
transitive.
It is quite possible to have three infix operators O1, O2 and O3
such that O1 on the left has precedence over O2 on the right,
that O2 on the left has precedence over O3 on the right,
and yet O3 on the left has precedence over O1 on the right.
But for most purposes this possibility is not required at all,
indeed users would probably find it confusing.
If the precedence relation can be made transitive and even linear,
then it becomes possible to assign
to each symbol a numeric precedence strength.
More precisely, for each symbol <CODE>s</CODE> two numbers are needed,
conventionally called <CODE>f(s)</CODE> for the precedence on the left,
and <CODE>g(s)</CODE> for the precedence on the right.
The algorithm now becomes:
<XMP>
        Push a marker onto an otherwise empty stack
        WHILE stack contains more than one symbol OR
            the current input symbol is not the terminator DO
          IF f(the symbol on top of the stack)
              &lt;= g(the next input symbol) THEN
            shift the next input symbol onto the stack
          ELSE
            REPEAT
              pop the top element off the stack
              UNTIL f(the symbol on top of the stack)
                < g(the symbol most recently popped)
</XMP>
The most difficult part is to find,
for each input symbol,
numeric values for the f and g functions.
When suitable values have been found,
it is easy enough to put them into two arrays, say f and g.
Thus, just as the precedence relations program can be driven by
a two dimensional array of relations,
so the precedence functions program can be driven by two numeric arrays
f and g.
There is no way to build error detection into the algorithm,
see Aho and Ullman (1977, p 171),
except by ad hoc methods.
But it is again an easy matter to extend the program just slightly
so that it becomes a translator into postfix.
It is not essential that the postfix version uses exactly the same
symbols, it is easy enough translate into a different
symbolism.
(The sample program translates the infix constants <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1</CODE>
into the postfix constants <CODE>T</CODE> and <CODE>F</CODE>.)
<P>
The following is a record of an interaction with the program.
Like the preceding program,
this one does not echo its input.
After each prompt <CODE>ready</CODE>,
it reads a formula typed by the user.
If the formula is preceded by <CODE>?</CODE>,
then the program goes into tracing mode.

<H2>Exercises and reading</H2>
<P>
<EM>Ad hoc error detection</EM>:
The precedence function algorithm cannot detect errors,
because for any symbol on top of the stack
and any input symbol,
one of the three relations <CODE>></CODE>, <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>></CODE> must hold
for their <CODE>f</CODE>- and <CODE>g</CODE>-values.
Hence there is no way of encoding error conditions,
as was done with the matrix of precedence relations.
For example, the algorithm will happily shift two adjacent
atoms on the stack.
Find a way of adding extra <EM>ad hoc</EM> code
to the algorithm so that errors can be handled correctly.
You might experiment with a further function, say <CODE>h</CODE>.
<P>
<EM>Parsing without tables</EM>:
Both programs are general,
they are driven by tables which specify
the input language and the translation.
It would be possible to write both programs without the tables.
Essentially this amounts to building the information which is
now in the tables into the programs.
Rewrite either the precedence relations program or the
precedence functions program in this way.
<P>
<EM>Changing the tables</EM>:
Experiment with changing the table in the <CODE>VALUE</CODE> part of the
precedence relations program,
or the tables in the <CODE>CONST</CODE> part of the precedence functions program.
Can you change them so that
the input language is in fully parenthesised infix
or in prefix? If not, why not?
<P>
<EM>Evaluator</EM>:
For either the precedence relations or the precedence functions program,
modify the algorithm and then the program and the tables
so as to make an evaluator for formulas without variables
but only with constants <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1</CODE>.
<P>
Write a parser which uses the method described towards
the end of the first section of this chapter.
Your program could be, but need not be,
driven by some kind of data structure
playing the role of the tables used here.
Augment your parser so that it becomes a translator.
<P>
<EM>Non-recursive truth table program</EM>:
Our truth table program had essentially three tasks to perform:
1) to translate from infix to postfix,
2) to generate all combinations of truth values, and
3) to evaluate the postfix.
Our program used recursion for 1) and 2),
but used an explicit stack for 3).
Now this chapter has shown how to do 1) without recursion.
Can you think of a non-recursive way of doing 2)?
This would give you a truth table program which does not use
recursion at all.
It should even be possible to write the entire program
without any procedures;
but many people would argue that such a style is unclear.
<P>
<EM>Reading</EM>:
For a different exposition of operator precedences
and a translator from arithmetic infix
to postfix which also uses a two dimensional table
but with slightly different stack operations,
see Collins (1986, pp 117 - 145).
For an operator precedence program
which translates from infix to postfix
but which is not table driven, see McCracken (1987, pp 111 - 120).
For a detailed theoretically oriented
exposition of operator precedence parsing,
see Aho and Ullman (1977, Section 5.3).
A short but usable exposition of LR parsing
is given in Capon and Jinks (1988, p 95).
A more detailed exposition is in Sudkamp (1988, Chapters 15 and 16).
For a very comprehensive treatment of LR-parsing,
