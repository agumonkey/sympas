In the previous chapter we wrote a translator,
in this chapter we shall write an evaluator.
Arithmetical expressions such as <code>2 + 3</code> have a value, here <code>5</code>;
and expressions such as <code>x + y</code> have a value which depends
on the values of the variables.
The same holds of logical formulas such as <code>p &amp; q</code>,
which is true if p is true and q is true, otherwise it is false.
To avoid complications with propositional variables,
we shall only use two constants: <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>,
for <code>FALSE</code> and <code>TRUE</code>.
Then for example the formula <code>1 &amp; 0</code> is false,
and we say that its value is <code>0</code>.
The evaluator uses infix notation,
but to keep the implementation as simple as possible,
outer parentheses may not be omitted.

<p>
The program INFEVL evaluates logical formulas in infix notation.
When the program is ready to read a formula,
it provides the prompt:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Formula :
</pre>

<p>
and then it expects a formula of propositional logic
</p>

<pre class="example">
formula  ::=
        '0' | '1' |
        '-' formula |
        '(' formula ( 'v' | '&amp;' | '&gt;' | '=' ) formula ')'
</pre>

<p>
The program ignores white space such as blanks, tabs or newlines.
When the reading of the formula is completed,
the program writes the value of the formula in the form
</p>

<pre class="example">
Value  : x
</pre>

<p>
where x is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
Then the program writes a new prompt.
Evaluation of formulas is defined recursively,
for atomic and for compound formulas.
Atomic formulas <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> evaluate to themselves.
Compound formulas are evaluated in accordance with the
following truth tables,
where <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are arbitrary formulas,
and the columns below give their values:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Unary Operator
    p   |       -p
    ----+---------
    0   |       1
    1   |       0
</pre>

<pre class="example">
Binary Operators
    p q   |     p v q   p &amp; q   p &gt; q   p = q
    ------+----------------------------------
    0 0   |       0       0       1       1
    0 1   |       1       0       1       0
    1 0   |       1       0       0       0
    1 1   |       1       1       1       1
</pre>

<p>
If during the reading of a formula an error is detected,
an error message is given.
If the offending character is ="X"=,
then the message will be one of
</p>

<pre class="example">
Error : seen "X" when "&amp;","v","&gt;" or "=" expected
Error : seen "X" when "0","1","-" or "(" expected
Error : seen "X" when ")" expected
</pre>

<p>
depending on where in the parse the error occurs.
The program terminates when it reaches
the end of the input file;
if this occurs in the middle of a formula then no error
message is given.
The following is an example run of the program.
The second last formula is here written over several lines,
and the last input line contains an intentional error.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Formula : 1
Value   : 1
Formula : (1 &amp; (1 &gt; 0))
Value   : 0
Formula : (             0 =     (1 = 0  ) )
Value   : 1
Formula : (
            (1 = 1)
          &amp;
            (1 &gt; 0)
          )
Value   : 0
Formula : ( 1 ? 0 )
  Error : seen "?" when "v","&amp;","&gt;" or "=" expected
</pre>

<p>
To exit the program one types <code>^C</code> (control-=C=).

<p>
If you have understood our previous program,
then this one should not be difficult.
But perhaps you should read about
parameters of procedures, both value parameters and variable parameters.
Also, you need to know about type declarations.
The main program is very simple &#x2014; essentially it is just a loop
for writing the prompt, reading and evaluating a formula,
and writing the value.
Nominally the loop goes on forever.
Before and after the loop we need two labels to jump
to: the first when an error has been detected,
the second when the end of the file has been reached.
The reading and the evaluating of a formula is done by
a procedure called <code>infix</code>.
It is best to design it first without the evaluation part in mind.
</p>

<p>
In infix notation there are essentially three places
where a user might have inserted blanks:
before a formula, before an infix operator,
and before a closing parenthesis.
At each of these places procedure <code>infix</code>
must be prepared to skip characters up to the next
printing character.
This is best done by a local procedure <code>getch</code>,
when it returns the last printing character is in a local variable.
The body of <code>infix</code> follows the BNF grammar for infix notation
almost to the letter.
But there are three places where errors can occur:
at the beginning of a formula, where an infix operator
should be, and where a closing parenthesis <code>)</code> should be.
The error reporting is best done by a local
procedure <code>error</code>,
which has to be told what the specific error message is.
The two local procedures <code>getch</code> and <code>error</code>
have bodies that are essentially familiar
from our previous program.
The procedure <code>error</code> has a (value) parameter
which is that part of the error message
which differs on its three possible calls.
Note that the type of the message parameter
has to be given globally in a type declaration.
</p>

<p>
As described up to this point,
procedure <code>infix</code> does not do any evaluating.
If you are writing the program yourself,
you are strongly urged to write the program
exactly up to here &#x2014;
all it can do is eat up characters and sometimes complain.
The evaluation part then comes as a refinement which
we describe next.
To begin with,
every subformula has a value,
and the whole formula has a value.
Procedure <code>infix</code> has to compute this value,
and when it has done so,
it has to put the value somewhere
for use later &#x2014; by itself if the call was recursive,
by the main program if the call was from the main program.
So we give procedure <code>infix</code> a so-called variable or
<code>VAR</code> parameter
which has to be of type Boolean.
When <code>infix</code> reads an atom
it sets this parameter to false or true respectively.
When <code>infix</code> reads a negation,
it calls itself,
but with a local variable of type boolean,
and when that returns it sets the parameter to the opposite
value of what that local value is.
When <code>infix</code> reads a parenthesis,
it calls itself with one local variable,
then it has to read the infix operator and remember it,
then it calls itself with another local variable.
Depending on what the remembered operator was,
it then sets the parameter to a value
computed from the two local variables.
</p>

<p>
Beginning programmers often have difficulty with
computing Boolean values,
probably because they do a lot of numeric programming
and encounter Boolean expressions only inside
<code>IF</code>'s and <code>WHILE</code>'s, and then in the form <code>i = 0</code> or the like.
In the infix evaluator,
suppose the parameter to be set is <code>x</code>,
and the two local variables are <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>.
Then for the remembered operator for material equivalence <code>=</code>,
a logically correct way of setting the parameter
to its value computed from the two local variables is this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
IF  y = true AND z = true  OR  y = false AND z = false
    THEN x := true
    ELSE x := false
</pre>

<p>
Apart from syntax errors which the Pascal compiler will pick up,
the statement reveals three independent and deep misunderstandings
of the data type Boolean.
If you cannot spot all four points,
you should consult a good text book.
</p>

<p>
For the remembered material equivalence operator <code>&gt;</code>
the situation is very similar.
You might initially write a complex <code>IF</code> statement
when actually a simple assignment statement will do.

<p>
The following is the standard Pascal source program
for the infix evaluator.
</p>

<pre class="example">
PROGRAM infix_evaluator(input,output);

LABEL 1, 99;

    value : boolean;

PROCEDURE infix(VAR x : boolean);

        oper := ch;
        infix(z);
        getch;
        IF ch &lt;&gt; ')' THEN
            error('")" expected                  ');
        CASE oper OF
            '&amp;' : x := y AND z;
            'v' : x := y OR z;
            '&gt;' : X := y &lt;= z;
            '=' : x := y = z;
            END (* CASE *)
        END;
    OTHERWISE
        error('"0","1","-" or "(" expected   ');
    END (* CASE *)
END; (* infix *)

BEGIN (* main *)
1: REPEAT
    write('Formula : ');
    infix(value);
    writeln('Value   : ', ord(value):1)
    UNTIL false;
99:
END.
</pre>

<p>
Strictly speaking it is not necessary to have the two local variables
<code>y</code> and <code>z</code> in procedure <code>infix</code>,
just one will do, say <code>z</code>.
Then for the formulas beginning with a parenthesis
the first recursive call has to be made <code>infix(x)</code>,
and the four cases changed accordingly.
But the saving does not justify even these few lines of explanation.

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Exercises and reading</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
<i>No GOTO</i>:
Rewrite the program without GOTO.
</p>

<p>
<i>Prefix notation</i>:
Write an evaluator for logical expressions in prefix
notation.
You should write the parser first,
and you might well do so by <i>cannibalising</i>
the program from the previous chapter.
Of course you will have to replace the atoms <code>a</code> .. <code>z</code>
by <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.
Write a manual, too.
A more ambitious project is to write an evaluator
for Cambridge notation.
</p>

<p>
<i>End of file</i>:
Neither this program nor the one in the previous chapter
treats end of file inside a formula well:
there really should be an error message.
But how can you then deal with end of file
when the user has finished?
Devise some method and implement it.
Change the manual where appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<i>Translator</i>:
Write a translator from fully parenthesised
infix notation to prefix notation.
This is one of the translation problems mentioned at the end
of the previous chapter which involved shifting operators
forward.
&gt;From fully parenthesised infix notation it is not all that hard.
</p>

<p>
<i>No outermost parentheses</i>:
It would be nice if the outermost parentheses of formulas
could be omitted. What problems do you foresee?
You should keep in mind that users might want to write
a formula over several lines,
and also that they write trailing blanks on the same line.
Discuss these problems, and propose a solution.
</p>

<p>
<i>Minimising Parentheses</i>:
When there are long conjunctions etc.
the infix notation used here forces users to write
a Lot of Irritating Silly Parentheses.
For example, assuming that
<code>p</code>, <code>q</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>s</code> are formulas,
instead of <code>p &amp; q &amp; r &amp; s</code>
one has to write <code>((p &amp; q) &amp; (r &amp; s))</code>
or something like that.
Can you fix the program
so that it allows operator precedences
described in the exercises of the previous chapter?
Does your method work for <code>p &gt; q &gt; r &gt; s</code>,
which users would want to read as <code>p &gt; (q &gt; (r &gt; s))</code>?
If you cannot change the program,
at least change the manual.
</p>

<p>
<i>An evaluation grammar</i>:
In the previous chapter we saw
a translation grammar for simultaneously specifying
the syntax of one language and its translation into another.
Try to devise a method
which can be used to simultaneously specify both the syntax
of infix formulas and their value.
For some advanced reading,
see Lewis, Rosenkrantz and Stearns (1978) on translation grammars
and attribute grammars.
For an exceptionally successful attempt at writing
semi-formal specifications without much need for explaining
the specification language,
see Lieberman (1987).
Another excellent self-explanatory semi-formal technique,
this time for a functional language,
is used throughout the book by
Glaser, Hankin and Till (1984).
</p>

<p>
<i>Values of subformulas</i>:
Change either the basic evaluator or any of its
more elaborate versions so that it writes
the value of <i>each</i> subformula underneath its operator.
</p>

<p>
<i>Arithmetic</i>:
Write an evaluator for arithmetical expressions
with just a few basic operations.
You should ensure that all possible user errors
are treated properly.
Write a manual.
</p>

<p>
<i>A Small APL</i>:
A sophisticated language with heavy emphasis on array processing
is APL.
For example, the expression <code>1 2 3 + 10 20 30</code>
denotes the addition of two arrays of three numbers each,
and its value is the array <code>11 22 33</code>.
Study a manual for APL (but do not be put off by the fancy characterset),
and then design and implement a very small subset,
but including at least array operations as in the example.
Note that whereas for evaluators of logical or arithmetical
expressions the values can always be returned in <code>VAR</code>
parameters,
this technique does not work when the values are
arrays of arbitrary sizes.
</p>

<p>
<i>A SET evaluator</i>:
Design a notation for expressions in which the basic values
are not truth values or numbers or arrays of numbers,
but sets of lower case letters.
You need notations for sets given by enumeration of their members,
for the nullset and the universal set,
for complementation, intersection, union and difference.
The four last mentioned operations should have some
reasonable precedences to minimise the need for parentheses.
Write a manual, design the program, write the program.
</p>

<p>
As a further refinement, add relational operators
for inclusion and equivalence of sets &#x2014;
note that these return logical values.
Once there are logical values,
it seems natural to add the truth functional connectives, too.
Give a lot of thought to the precedences
of 1)~the logical connectives,
2)~the relational operators,
and 3)~the set operations.
</p>

<p>
<i>Evaluators in other domains</i>:
You are in a city in which all streets run either north-south
or east-west.
Any movement you can make is in one of the four directions,
north, south, east and west &#x2014; taken to mean up to the next
intersection.
Call these moves <code>N</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>W</code>,
and a sequence of moves is written in the order of the moves,
e.g. <code>NES</code> means moving north, then east, then south.
Clearly that move is equivalent to just moving east.
Similarly, <code>NENWWS</code> is equivalent to <code>WN</code>.
Write a program which reads sequences of moves
and then writes a minimal sequence which is equivalent to it.
Note that often there will be several equivalent minimal sequences,
so some decision is needed as to which of the
equivalent minimal sequences is written out.
</p>

<p>
In modal logic there are three unary operators,
for negation, possibility and necessity.
Assume that they are written as the characters <code>-</code>, <code>P</code> and <code>N</code>.
In some modal logics different sequences of the unary operators
can be equivalent,
in the sense that when they operate on the same formula
then the resulting formulas are logically equivalent.
For example, in most modal logics <code>-N-</code> is equivalent to <code>P</code>,
and <code>-P-</code> is equivalent to <code>N</code>,
and in many modal logics <code>NP</code> and <code>PP</code> are equivalent to <code>P</code>.
Study some modal system, and write a program
which reduces sequences of unary operators to an equivalent minimal form.
Alternatively, write a program which does the same for
a temporal logic, in which the unary operators
are negation, always (in the future), sometimes (in the future)
and next (instant in time).
The idea of writing a program for reducing modalities
was suggested to me by Rory Deutsch.
